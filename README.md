# Create a Branch 

git checkout -b creates a branch and checks out that branch immediately. git branch with a branch name provided creates the branch but does not check it out.

# Pull from a Branch

A pull request is a way of facilitating a merge through the GitHub interface. It also provides a way to provide feedback and have collaboration before the merge happens.

# Push to a Branch 

This is a command that says “push the commits in the local branch to the remote branch”. Once this is executed, your commits since your last push will be available on GitHub.
Your initial push mayl ooks something like git push -u origin master

# Merge with Master

Run git merge master. This will take any changes that have been made to master since you created the branch and add them to your branch.

# Fork

Creating a “fork” is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. 

# Add a Collaborator
